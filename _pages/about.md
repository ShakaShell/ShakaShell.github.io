# Hi, I'm Michael Roberts.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and exploring new ways to protect data and systems. When I'm not diving into tech, you can find me hiking and camping, enjoying the outdoors, and reconnecting with nature.

## Interests

- **Cybersecurity:** I love learning about the latest trends and challenges in protecting networks and data.
- **Hiking:** Exploring new trails and enjoying the serenity of the wilderness.
- **Camping:** Spending time outdoors, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
